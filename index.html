	<p>This is a work in progress! (Working demo <abbr title="to be developed">TBD</abbr>)</p>

		<h2>What is relevance?</h2>

		<p>This library was developed to help hide groups of questions in a web form.
			The idea behind this is that forms are complicated, and asking a smaller number of questions is simpler.
			More to the point, asking the right questions at the right time is easier.
			What's another name for the right question at the right time? Relevance!</p>

		<p>You might also hear this user interface technique called 'progressive disclosure'.</p>
	</article>

	<aside id="relevance-vs-show-hide">
		<h3>More than show() and hide()</h3>

		<p>Yes, you can show and hide parts of forms (or any element on a web page) easily with jquery show() and hide() methods.
			In fact, the relevance library uses show (slideDown actually) and hide to do just that.
			But it does a little more.</p>

		<p>When you hide a form input field, it is still kind of there.
			Most importantly, when the form is submitted those fields aren't ignored.
			The fact that they aren't shown to the user really isn't taken into consideration.
			If you want to stop form fields being submitted, you need to disable them.
			This relevance library does exactly that.</p>
	</aside>

	<article id="instruction-based">
		<h2>Instruction-based relevance</h2>

		<p>If you are more comfortable with HTML than javascript, instruction-based relevance is for you.
			Simply include 'instructions' about when questions are relevant and let this library do the rest.
			As a bonus, instructions are useful for users that have javascript disabled.</p>

		<p>Behind the scenes, the instruction-based relevance simply uses the <a href="#relevant-when">relevantWhen API</a>a> (described below) to setup the form.</p>

		<h3>Format of instructions</h3>
		<p>TODO</p>
	</article>

	<article id="relevant-when">
		<h2>The 'relevantWhen' API</h2>

		<p>If you want full control over when a question is relevant, use the relevantWhen API.
			This allows you to specify when an item is relevant, based on the value of any question that appears earlier in the same form.</p>
